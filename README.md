# Queens
This is console game called Queens. It was developed for one of my competition i participated.
The game is planned for two players. The gameplay is based on movements of the queen from the chess,
with every placement of the queen the all possible movements of the specific queen
are being marked and the winner is those who put the last queen and fill all the board.
